================================= CODEDEX GAME JAM 2025 =================================

[16/12/2025]

Welcome to my devlog for this project!
I'm participating in Codedex's Game Jam 2025, with the theme 'Changing of Time'.
Been sleeping on it for a quite some time but I'm finally getting to work!

-> GAME CONCEPT:
You work as a software dev in a futuristic company.

-> NOTE: this is based on an existing prototype I made a year ago, so I'm not working
completely from scratch. However, any existing concepts and code that I'm working
on top of are my own original works!!

What existed before:
- Classes for Player, Level, Renderers (using SFML)
- Basic modules/systems (player movement, checking window bounds, collision checks)
- Game Loop in main.cpp (core logic for previous game, rendering, etc)

What is added/modified for this game jam:
